# Coding Guideline

- Follow: Always *follow* the intension of the original code. Please prompt yourself 'I think the code is [code functionality]. And now the user wants [user request]. I need to keep [code functionality] and complete [user request]. Any work breaking this rule is useless' before you change any public interfaces or functionalities. 
- Search: Use grep tool to search for all necessary, yet minimal information. Explore files thoroughly before you start implementation.
