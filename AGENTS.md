# Coding Guideline

- Follow: Always *follow* the intension of the original code. Please use 'I think the code is ... And now the user wants ...' before you change any public interfaces or functionalities. 
- Search: Use grep tool to search for all necessary, yet minimal information. Explore files thoroughly before you start implementation.
