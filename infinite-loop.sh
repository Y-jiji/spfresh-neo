Fix spfresh_stress_test_uint8: it must run with SPDK using device 'b4:00.0 Non-Volatile memory controller: Samsung Electronics Co Ltd NVMe SSD Controller S4LV008[Pascal]'. Append to BUGFIX.md to summarize what worked and what is not. Refer to BUGFIX.md to see what worked and what did not. The prompt that generated spfresh_stress_test_uint8 is: 'Implement a multi-threaded executable that stress tests SPFresh.  Your solution should fully utilize any performance optimizations provided by SPDK-based SPFresh. CLI takes 3 file paths, k-nearest neighbor search parameter k, and parameters necessary for building an empty SPDK-based index.  First file path: data file, store the vectors in binary format for insert/search. when reading the file, each vector should be attached with a sequence number starting from zero. whether the vector is insert/search is determined by a pure function of the sequence number, you can add a dummy implementation there that I will fill later.  Second file path: output log file, store vectorId returned by insertVector and sequence number together, store the sequence number feed into nnSearch and the output vectorIds. Third file path: every second, log the number of queries answered and the number of vectors inserted. Implement your solution and create a dummy data file to test your result.'" >& "../ITERATION $X.txt"
